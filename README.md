# xmapgui

this source code is ugly and hard to scale so there's not too much benefit to looking at it. however, if you do want to build it:

* target .net 5.0
* use ini-parser 2.5.2
* use mono.gtksharp 2.12.0.1

i don't know markdown very well so go [here](https://deice.neocities.org/content/smbx/xgui.html) for more info and a tutorial.
